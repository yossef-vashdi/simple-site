      <p>
        Hi ! my name is Yossi, I use this site to practice and express myself.
        <br />
        it won't be a regular portfolio, but I think it can show enough
        depiction of me, so it does part of the job.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        please feel free to share your thought with me, I'll be happy to hear.
        and have a nice day !
      </p>
